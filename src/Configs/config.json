    "about_me": "Hi! I'm Zahra, a senior undergraduate student at IUST. In the recent years, I've become interested in AI and specifically Machine Learning. Now, I am in my 8th semester, and I'm busy doing my Final Project of BSc. I have received fully-funded admission offers for a master's degree from three universities including, the University of Alberta, Simon Frasor University, and University of Western Ontario for Fall 2020. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, I cannot travel to Canada for the Fall semester. So, I am still in Iran working on my final project and some other projects as well. ",
